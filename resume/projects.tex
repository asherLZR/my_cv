        \item {While it is well-known that the best way to learn is through teaching, this is a severely underutilised mode of learning. We addressed this by proposing a video learning website, made with Node.js and Vue.js, where the students are the content providers.}
        \item {Complementing traditional peer-to-peer learning methods like tutorials and forum posts, Perspective was online and encouraged teaching as another form of validating understanding of content.}

      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {To address the siloing of content by major online news curators, built a news archival website which performed NLP and analytics on user-read articles collected by a browser extension. The website was envisioned to be used as a reflective tool for users to engage with their personal reading history, outside the influence of recommendation engines.}
        \item {Built in 24hrs with a team of 5. It was my first experience leading a tech team and building a live website from scratch.}
        \item {In a crash course, learnt technologies such as MongoDB, Heroku, React, and Express.js.}
